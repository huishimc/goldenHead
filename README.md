# goldenHead
### A very simple plugin
*1.13~1.21.8*
*(Theoretically, yes, because I developed it with the API of 1.20.1)*

I've got a few features
* Players can drop heads after death
* Enchanted Golden Apple can be synthesized from the skull and eight gold ingots
* You can set how long players wait before losing their heads
* You can also control whether to synthesize enchanted golden apples
* You can customize your message settings
* Built-in placeholders also support PlaceholderAPI
